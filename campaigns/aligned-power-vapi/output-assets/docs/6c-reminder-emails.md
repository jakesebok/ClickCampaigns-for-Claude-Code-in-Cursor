# 6C Scorecard reminder emails

Reminder emails are sent to **active clients** (from `portal_active_clients`) during and immediately after the weekly scorecard window. The cron job calls `/api/cron/6c-reminders`; the API decides which email to send based on the **current Eastern day**. To make Vercel Hobby more reliable, the project now runs multiple fallback cron hours that still land in the **11am-noon Eastern reminder window**, and it uses **Resend idempotency keys** so redundant attempts do not create duplicate emails.

**Who receives each email:**
- **Friday** ("Your scorecard is available"): All active clients.
- **Saturday** and **Sunday**: Only active clients who have **not yet** submitted their 6C scorecard for this week's window (Friday 12pm – Sunday 6pm Eastern). Clients who already filled it out are skipped.
- **Monday** and **Tuesday**: Only active clients who have at least one prior scored 6Cs submission, missed the most recent Friday-Sunday window, and still have not set a manual Vital Action after the window closed.

## Schedule (Eastern)

`vercel.json` defines **three** daily cron entries: `5 15 * * *`, `5 16 * * *`, and `5 17 * * *`.

That gives the reminder system multiple fallback attempts around the Eastern 11am-noon window. The API sends one email based on the Eastern day, and Resend idempotency prevents duplicate sends if more than one cron attempt lands on the same day:

| Day (during the fallback reminder window) | Email |
|-------------------------------------|--------|
| Friday | "Your scorecard is available for this week" |
| Saturday | "Reminder: Get your scorecard in this weekend" |
| Sunday | "Just a few hours left to submit" (only Sunday email) |
| Monday | "Kick the week off right — set your Vital Action" |
| Tuesday | "Still time to set this week's Vital Action" |

## Setup

**→ Step-by-step guide:** [6c-reminders-setup-guide.md](./6c-reminders-setup-guide.md) — adding RESEND_API_KEY and CRON_SECRET in Vercel, and verifying your “from” domain in Resend.

Summary:

- **Resend:** Emails are sent via [Resend](https://resend.com). Create an API key and add **RESEND_API_KEY** in Vercel. Verify your domain in Resend so you can send from e.g. `scorecard@alignedpower.coach`, or set **SIX_C_FROM_EMAIL** to a verified address.
- **Cron secret:** Generate a random string (e.g. `openssl rand -hex 32`) and add **CRON_SECRET** in Vercel. Vercel Cron sends `Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>` when it runs.

### 3. Vercel Cron

`vercel.json` in this folder already defines:

- Path: `/api/cron/6c-reminders`
- Schedule: `5 15 * * *`, `5 16 * * *`, and `5 17 * * *`. The handler uses the fallback runs that still land in the Eastern 11am-noon window for the current day, then sends based on Eastern time: Friday → “available”, Saturday → reminder, Sunday → “just a few hours left”, Monday/Tuesday → Vital Action catch-up for missed submissions.

After deployment, Cron runs automatically. You can confirm in Vercel → Project → Settings → Crons.

### 4. Optional env

- **SIX_C_REPLY_TO** – Reply-to address for reminder emails.

## Manual test

Without sending email (to see which type would run):

1. Call the API during the Friday-Tuesday fallback reminder hours (or change the server time for testing).
2. With sending: set **RESEND_API_KEY** and **CRON_SECRET**, then:

   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET" "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/cron/6c-reminders"
   ```

For **status only** (no email): add `?status=1` to the URL. For **one test email** to your inbox: add `?test_send=your@email.com`. To force a specific template during testing, add `&force_type=available|saturday|one-hour-left|monday-vital-action|tuesday-vital-action`. Forced-template test sends are restricted to `jacob@alignedpower.coach`. Full testing steps: [6c-reminders-setup-guide.md](./6c-reminders-setup-guide.md#testing-that-it-works).

## Hobby plan note

Vercel Hobby timing is only guaranteed **within the scheduled hour**. This project keeps three daily cron entries (`5 15 * * *`, `5 16 * * *`, and `5 17 * * *`) so Friday-Tuesday reminders get multiple fallback attempts that still land in the Eastern 11am-noon window. The handler sends based on the Eastern day, and Resend idempotency keys prevent duplicate emails if more than one attempt runs successfully.
